A simple game of odds and evens between the user and the computer. The user is playing first and has to choose, odds or evens, and  to say how many fingers he is putting out. Then the computer, with the use of Random, picks a random number from 0-5. After that the program calculates the sum of the two numbers and print the winner according the previous choices.
